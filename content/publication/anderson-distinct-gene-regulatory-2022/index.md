abstract: "The social environment is a major determinant of morbidity, mortality and\
  \ Darwinian fitness in social animals. Recent studies have begun to uncover the\
  \ molecular processes associated with these relationships, but the degree to which\
  \ they vary across different dimensions of the social environment remains unclear.\
  \ Here, we draw on a long-term field study of wild baboons to compare the signatures\
  \ of affiliative and competitive aspects of the social environment in white blood\
  \ cell gene regulation, under both immune-stimulated and non-stimulated conditions.\
  \ We find that the effects of dominance rank on gene expression are directionally\
  \ opposite in males versus females, such that high-ranking males resemble low-ranking\
  \ females, and vice versa. Among females, rank and social bond strength are both\
  \ reflected in the activity of cellular metabolism and proliferation genes. However,\
  \ while we observe pronounced rank-related differences in baseline immune gene activity,\
  \ only bond strength predicts the fold-change response to immune (lipopolysaccharide)\
  \ stimulation. Together, our results indicate that the directionality and magnitude\
  \ of social effects on gene regulation depend on the aspect of the social environment\
  \ under study. This heterogeneity may help explain why social environmental effects\
  \ on health and longevity can also vary between measures. This article is part of\
  \ the theme issue `The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future\
  \ prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
