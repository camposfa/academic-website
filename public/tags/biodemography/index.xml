      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;dynamics-of-primate-populations-in-the-acg&#34;&gt;Dynamics of Primate Populations in the ACG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested in how primate populations change over time as their habitats and climates change. We have carried out repeated large-scale censuses of primates in the ACG to monitor changes in the capuchin and howler monkey populations over time. This work spans several decades (starting with early census work in 1983), and is in collaboration with Linda Fedigan, Kathy Jack, Jeremy Hogan, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Primate Life History Database</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-on-the-working-group&#34;&gt;Background on the Working Group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://plhdb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Primate Life History Database&lt;/a&gt; is a unique compilation of full life-course information from seven wild populations that have been studied for at least 30 years. The database contains standardized records for thousands of individual primates that have been followed from birth to death. These primate populations are some of the best-studied wild primates on earth. Formed over the course of several meetings from 2005 to 2007, the original core members of the PLHD include co-organizers Susan Alberts and Karen Strier, along with Jeanne Altmann, Diane Brockman, Anne Bronikowski, Marina Cords, Linda Fedigan, Bill Morris, Anne Pusey, Tara Stoinski. Following Diane&amp;rsquo;s retirement, Rich Lawler joined the working group in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/cards/plhd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PLHD Working Group&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My involvement with the PLHD working group began in 2015, when I was brought in to investigate the question of how &amp;ldquo;vital rates&amp;rdquo;—that is, birth rates and death rates—are affected by climate variability. This culminated in our 2017 paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;/publication/camposdoesclimatevariability-2017/&#34;&gt;Campos et al. (2017) &lt;em&gt;Global Change Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a post-doc in Susan Alberts&amp;rsquo; lab at Duke, I continued to work on several unresolved questions about life history evolution using this exceptionally valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early Life Adversity</title>
      <link>/project/early-life-adversity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adversity during early life can reach far into the future to exert profound effects on health and well-being during adulthood.
Striking parallels exist between early-life effects in humans and in natural animal populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading conceptual models for early-life effects propose different evolutionary explanations for these phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental constraints models&lt;/strong&gt; propose that harsh early-life conditions lead to developmental tradeoffs that prioritize immediate survival at the cost of reduced health, reproduction, and/or survival later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive adaptive response (PAR) models&lt;/strong&gt; posit that early-life conditions provide cues for predicting future conditions, leading to adaptive responses during development that maximize evolutionary fitness under predicted conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several important gaps in our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, which of these frameworks best explains the emergence of early-life effects in nonhuman primates?
&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, to what extent are such effects embedded in our evolutionary history?
&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, what are the optimal approaches to mitigating disparities in health and well-being that result from exposure early-life adversity in humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by these questions, I am leveraging a 
&lt;a href=&#34;/project/plhd/&#34;&gt;database of life history data&lt;/a&gt; on seven natural primate populations to shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the far-reaching effects of early-life adversity and to test the universality of these effects among close relatives of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
