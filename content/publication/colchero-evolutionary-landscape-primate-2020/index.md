abstract: Is it possible to slow the rate of aging, or do biological constraints limit
  its plasticity? We test this &amp;lsquo;invariant rate of aging&amp;rsquo; hypothesis
  with an unprecedented collection of 39 human and nonhuman primate datasets across
  seven genera. We first recapitulate, in nonhuman primates, the highly regular relationship
  between life expectancy and lifespan equality seen in humans. We next demonstrate
  that variation in the rate of aging within genera is orders of magnitude smaller
  than variation in pre-adult and age-independent mortality. Finally, we demonstrate
  that changes in the rate of aging, but not other mortality parameters, produce striking,
  species-atypical changes in mortality patterns. Our results support the invariant
  rate of aging hypothesis, implying biological constraints on how much the human
  rate of aging can be slowed.
