abstract: "Aging, for virtually all life, is inescapable. However, within populations,\
  \ biological aging rates vary. Understanding sources of variation in this process\
  \ is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. We constructed\
  \ a DNA methylation-based age predictor for an intensively studied wild baboon population\
  \ in Kenya. Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting 'epigenetic clock'\
  \ closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat\
  \ older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not\
  \ explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity\
  \ and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank:\
  \ high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic\
  \ age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank\
  \ for male baboons— the best predictor of reproductive success— imposes costs consistent\
  \ with a 'live fast, die young' life history strategy."
