abstract: 'Are differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation
  across the adult life span linked to differences in survival? This question has
  been the subject of considerable debate. We analyze the link between survival and
  fecal glucocorticoid (GC) measures in a wild primate population, leveraging an unusually
  extensive longitudinal dataset of 14,173 GC measurements from 242 adult female baboons
  over 1634 female years. We document a powerful link between GCs and survival: Females
  with relatively high current GCs or high lifelong cumulative GCs face an elevated
  risk of death. A hypothetical female who maintained GCs in the top 90% for her age
  across adulthood would be expected to lose 5.4 years of life relative to a female
  who maintained GCs in the bottom 10% for her age. Hence, differences among individuals
  in HPA axis activity provide valuable prognostic information about disparities in
  life span. In wild female baboons, high fecal glucocorticoid concentrations measured
  repeatedly across adulthood predict shorter life spans. In wild female baboons,
  high fecal glucocorticoid concentrations measured repeatedly across adulthood predict
  shorter life spans.'
