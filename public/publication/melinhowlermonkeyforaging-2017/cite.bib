 abstract = {Primates possess remarkably variable color vision, and the
ecological and social factors shaping this variation remain
heavily debated. Here, we test whether central tenants of
the folivory hypothesis of routine trichromacy hold for the
foraging ecology of howler monkeys. Howler monkeys (genus
Alouatta) and paleotropical primates (Parvorder:
Catarrhini) have independently acquired routine trichromacy
through fixation of distinct mid- to
long-wavelength-sensitive (M/LWS) opsin genes on the
X-chromosome. The presence of routine trichromacy in
howlers, while other diurnal neotropical monkeys
(Platyrrhini) possess polymorphic trichromacy, is poorly
understood. A selective force proposed to explain the
evolution of routine trichromacy in
catarrhines—reliance on young, red
leaves—has received scant attention in howlers,
a gap we fill in this study. We recorded diet, sequenced
M/LWS opsin genes in four social groups of Alouatta
palliata, and conducted colorimetric analysis of leaves
consumed in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. For a majority
of food species, including Ficus trees, an important
resource year-round, young leaves were more chromatically
conspicuous from mature leaves to trichromatic than to
hypothetical dichromatic phenotypes. We found that 18% of
opsin genes were MWS/LWS hybrids; when combined with
previous research, the incidence of hybrid M/LWS opsins in
this species is 13%. In visual models of food
discrimination ability, the hybrid trichromatic phenotype
performed slightly poorer than normal trichromacy, but
substantially better than dichromacy. Our results provide
support for the folivory hypothesis of routine trichromacy.
Similar ecological pressures, that is, the search for
young, reddish leaves, may have driven the independent
evolution of routine trichromacy in primates on separate
continents. We discuss our results in the context of
balancing selection acting on New World monkey opsin genes
and hypothesize that howlers experience stronger selection
against dichromatic phenotypes than other sympatric
species, which rely more heavily on cryptic foods.},
