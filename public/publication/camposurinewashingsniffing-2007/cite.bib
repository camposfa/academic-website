 abstract = {Urine washing (UW) is taxonomically widespread among
strepsirhines and platyrrhines, yet its functional
significance is still unclear. We used 2274 h of focal
follows of 35 adult and subadult wild white-faced capuchins
(Cebus capucinus) to test 1) the intergroup signaling,
intragroup social signaling, and thermoregulatory
hypotheses for UW and 2) the hypothesis that individuals
sniff each other's urine and other traces to gather
socially significant information. Males engaged in
significantly more UW than females. All 5 $α$-males
engaged in more UW than subordinate males did, including 4
$α$-males that increased their UW rate above that of
their male groupmates after their rise to $α$ rank.
Males engaged in significantly less UW while in view of
other males than at other times. Male-male sniffing rates
do not correlate with either aggression rate or dominance
rank distance. Urine washing rates did not increase while
subjects were in parts of their home range where more
intergroup encounters occurred. Urine washing rates were
highest early in the morning and late in the afternoon,
presumably when temperatures were coolest. The data do not
support either the thermoregulatory or social signaling
hypothesis. We suggest that experiments with captive
capuchins are necessary to resolve the issue of the
function of urine washing in the taxon.},
