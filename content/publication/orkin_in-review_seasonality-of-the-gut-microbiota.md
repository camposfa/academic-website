abstract = "Research on the gut microbiota of free-ranging mammals is offering new insights into dietary ecology. However, for free-ranging primates, little information is available for how microbiomes are influenced by ecological variation through time. Primates inhabiting seasonal tropical dry forests undergo stark decreases in food abundance and water availability, which have been linked to adverse health effects. Throughout the course of a seasonal transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys (_Cebus capucinus imitator_) in Sector Santa Rosa, Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Our 16s rRNA sequencing data reveals that unlike other primates, the white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects models indicate that abundances of these genera are associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of fruit and arthropods. Further, beta diversity clusters by rainfall season, irrespective of social group membership. We observed high diversity of Proteobacteria throughout the year, which are overrepresented during the wet season and periods of low-fruit abundance, as are enteric pathogens such as Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Pseudomonas. We contend that ecological and microbial fluctuations may contribute to negative health consequences among white-faced capuchin monkeys at Sector Santa Rosa."
