abstract: "Although males often disperse to increase their immediate access to mates,\
  \ it is unclear whether they also consider potential future reproductive opportunities.\
  \ We investigated whether immediate or delayed reproductive opportunities predicted\
  \ dispersal decisions and reproductive success of subordinate immigrant male white-faced\
  \ capuchins in the Sector Santa Rosa, the Área de Conservaciń Guanacaste, Costa\
  \ Rica. We collected genetic, behavioral, and demographic data from four social\
  \ groups across 20~years. We genotyped individuals at up to 20 short tandem repeat\
  \ loci to determine paternity. Having previously sired offspring in a group did\
  \ not predict the subordinate immigrant male's likelihood of staying or dispersing.\
  \ Instead, a male was more likely to remain in the group if he was younger and likely\
  \ to benefit from queuing for future reproductive opportunities. Subordinate immigrant\
  \ males were more likely to sire offspring if they resided with a long-term alpha\
  \ male and his mature daughters, who avoid inbreeding. Reproductive output was similar\
  \ among three categories of males: those that became alpha immediately after immigration,\
  \ those that became alpha after queuing, and subordinate males that resided with\
  \ a long-term alpha male and his mature daughters. These three categories of males\
  \ had higher reproductive success than subordinates who did not reside with mature\
  \ daughters of the alpha male. Waiting for reproductive opportunities can lead to\
  \ high reproductive success and could be important in maintaining tolerant or cooperative\
  \ male-male relationships in species with high reproductive skew, long alpha male\
  \ tenures, and intense between-group mating competition requiring cooperative male\
  \ group defense."
