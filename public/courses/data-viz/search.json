    "text": "Absolute Paths\nAbsolute paths start from the root (top-level) directory of your filesystem and include every step (sub-folder) you must take through the filesystem to reach the target location. The working directory is irrelevant to a properly specified absolute path. In other words, an absolute path points to the same location on a particular computer regardless of your R session’s current working directory.\nExamples of made-up absolute paths:\n\nWindows  : \"C:\\Users\\czx412\\Documents\\deeply\\nested\\path\\that\\only\\I\\can\\use\\data\\my_file.csv\"\nMac   / Linux  : \"/Users/czx412/Documents/deeply/nested/path/that/only/I/can/use/data/my_file.csv\"\n\nNote that absolute paths look different depending on the operating system. In Windows, they start with a drive letter followed by a colon, and in Mac/Linux they start with a forward slash.\nAlso, for weird historical reasons, paths in Windows traditionally use \\, while Unix/Mac use / to separate the folder names. This difference adds an extra complication: \\ is a special character in R, which means that the Windows path as written above would not work in R. Fortunately, most apps in Windows (including R) have added support for paths that use /:\n\nAbsolute path in Windows    that would work in R: \"C:/Users/czx412/Documents/deeply/nested/path/that/only/I/can/use/data/my_file.csv\".\n\nYou can still write your paths using \\ if you’re running R on Windows, but because the single backslash is a special character, you need to use two of them each time:\n\nAbsolute path in Windows    that would work in R, as written by the utterly deranged: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\czx412\\\\Documents\\\\deeply\\\\nested\\\\path\\\\that\\\\only\\\\I\\\\can\\\\use\\\\data\\\\my_file.csv\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe independence of absolute paths from the working directory concept might make you think absolute paths are always the way to go in R. And you’d be wrong. Avoid using absolute paths in R!\n\n\nAbsolute paths are a common source of problems.\nAside from their annoying length, absolute paths don’t work on different computers and tend to break over time. A file that exists in a certain place on your computer right now almost certainly does not exist in that exact same place on someone else’s computer, or on another computer that you use now or in the future. But if you use relative paths (see below) in a consistent way, then they should work other computers, regardless of where the project root directory is located in each different computer’s file system.\nNot sharing code with anybody or using multiple computers right at this very moment? Don’t forget future-you! Current-you should should have an interest in helping future-you to work efficiently rather than sabotaging their work by filling your R scripts with what will eventually become broken file paths."

For this to work properly, the program needs to know your assumed starting point: our old friend, the working directory.\nHere’s an example of a relative path:\n\nAny system: \"data/my_file.csv\"\n\nTranslation: in the working directory, look in a subfolder called \"data\" for a file called \"my_file.csv\".\nHence, the relative path \"data/my_file.csv\" would be interpreted in any R session as simply appending this to the end of the R session’s working directory, which in my case results in:\n\n\n[1] \"/Users/czx412/Documents/Work/UTSA/Teaching/Data Visualization/Data Visualization - Fall 2023/website/assignments/week-02/data/my_file.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Characters\n\n\n\nThere are a few special characters that are useful when using relative paths:\n\n~ is the user’s home directory. On this particular computer, ~ is equivalent to “/Users/czx412”. This will change depending on which computer I’m using.\n.. is the parent directory.

    "text": "R session vs. Quarto/RMarkdown\nAnother sneaky source of problems, even when you’re working in a project and using relative paths, can occur when you are reading or writing files from a Quarto document (all of this is also true for R Markdown, but for the sake of brevity, I will only refer to Quarto below).\nSpecifically, problems often occur when your .qmd file is located somewhere other than your project root folder. And the simple reason is that a Quarto document functions temporarily as its own, self-contained R session while it is rendering. When this happens, the working directory for the rendering document becomes whatever folder the .qmd file lives in, regardless of the working directory in your “main” R session.\nIf the .qmd file is in the project root folder, there’s no problem, because the working directories for both the R session and rendering document are the same.\nBut if the .qmd file is located somewhere else—say, in a subfolder of your project, or in some other location entirely—then you can get problems. In such cases, a command to load data using a relative path that runs successfully in your R script (or when executed in your R session from the .qmd file itself) will fail during rending, and vice versa."

When the package is first loaded, you’ll get a message telling you the absolute path to your project root.\n\nlibrary(\"here\")\n\nhere() starts at /Users/czx412/Documents/Work/UTSA/Teaching/Data Visualization/Data Visualization - Fall 2023/website\n\n\nThe here() function locates a file relative to your project’s root folder, and converts this behind the scenes into a correct absolute path for whatever computer you’re currently using, regardless of whether it’s used in an R session or while rendering a Quarto document. This is how you use it:\n\n# Specify path to a csv file in project root folder\nhere(\"file_i_want.csv\")\n\n[1] \"/Users/czx412/Documents/Work/UTSA/Teaching/Data Visualization/Data Visualization - Fall 2023/website/file_i_want.csv\"\n\n# Specify path to a csv file located in a subfolder called \"data\" in your project root folder\nhere(\"data/file_i_want.csv\")\n\n[1] \"/Users/czx412/Documents/Work/UTSA/Teaching/Data Visualization/Data Visualization - Fall 2023/website/data/file_i_want.csv\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe file path that you actually provide to the here() function is always a simple relative path. The absolute paths generated by the function will (and should) look different in your document from mine and everyone else’s.\n\n\nWhy would you want to use this? Two main reasons:\n\nThe same command will “just work” whether it is run from your console, an R source file, or while rendering a Quarto document.\nIt is not affected by your fiddling around with setwd() (which I suggest always avoiding if possible). Instead, it will figure out the top level of your current project, and locate the file from there.\n\nWe will explore this in more detail in the activity below."

Most concepts will be first introduced in assigned readings outside of class, leaving class time to focus on developing practical skills, completing activities, making progress on individual projects. We will cover topics in both data visualization as well as data manipulation. Students are encouraged to work collaboratively in and out of class. The online course schedule provides an overview of the topics covered as well as links to weekly readings, in-class activities, and any lecture material.

We will cover principles of tidy data, strategies for data exploration, and principles of visual presentation. We will use the R computing environment, but no prior programming experience is required. The emphasis is on gaining practical skills that will empower students to answer questions with data.\n\n\nCourse Goals\nThis course will provide students an opportunity to master theoretical concepts in data visualization and to acquire valuable skills for exploring data and producing statistical graphics. Students will learn how to use R to produce visualizations and work with quantitative data, and to apply these skills to communicate scientific knowledge effectively.\n\n\nStudent Learning Objectives/Outcomes\nDuring this semester, students will have the opportunity to:\n\nLearn fundamental principles and best practices for the visual display of quantitative data.\nBecome familiar with data input, analysis, and export using the R statistical computing environment.\nAchieve proficiency with key R packages for data visualization and exploration.\nDevelop skills in written and oral communication and graphical display of data through online activities, small group assignments, and individual projects.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nThere are no prerequisites for this class. In particular, prior programming experience is not required. Some familiarity with quantitative methods and data analysis would be helpful. Students with significant experience in R should still find new things to learn or important knowledge to review in each lesson.\n\n\nCourse Materials\nAll reading materials will be online or posted to the course website. Assigned readings should be completed before the start of class on the day indicated.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website. Announcements will be emailed through Canvas Announcements periodically. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course."

    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nIn-Class Exercises\nAs a (mostly) flipped classroom, our in-class time will involve brief refreshers on new concepts introduced in the readings followed by working on exercises that relate to those concepts. These exercises will include activities that the instructor will describe in class. While students are working on these exercises, the instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material that they find confusing, help identify problems that are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel applications and alternative approaches to the data visualization challenges that students are working to complete.\nAssigned in-class exercises can be found under the relevant week of the course schedule.\n\n\nSmall Projects\nDuring the term, there will be two small data visualization projects that each student must complete. The professor will provide a data set and detailed instructions for each project. In brief, the projects will be visualization challenges in which the student will read in the data set in R, produce one or more visualizations of the data, and provide a written narrative (~1000 words) of interesting aspects or insights gained in the process of analyzing the data. The submission should be a Quarto/RMarkdown report in HTML format, and it must include the R code used, the embedded visualizations, and the written narrative. Please also submit the .qmd file used to make the report.\n\n\nFinal Project\nFor the final project, students are encouraged to find and/or use a data set related to their thesis topic, if possible. If this is not possible, the professor can help to find a data set on a topic relevant to the student’s interests. Students must demonstrate and document both data tidying/preparation and data visualization. Further instructions will be provided. The submitted final project should include:\n\nThe raw data set used in the analysis (contact me if there are any concerns about this).\nA Quarto/RMarkdown report in HTML format with all R code used, at least 3 plots, and a written narrative of approximately 1000 words.\nThe .qmd file used to make the report.\nA digital poster (in a digital format such as PDF—no actual printed posters please!), similar to what you might present at an academic conference, that presents your project visually.\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\nRegular attendance will be essential to the successful completion of this course. Attendance is mandatory and will count toward your final grade. We are aiming for a supportive and cooperative learning environment. To accomplish this, I expect students to be actively engaged participants in all classroom activities."

Refrain from distracting behavior, such as talking during lectures, and wait until class is dismissed before packing up your belongings. Please try not to arrive late or leave early.

Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.
