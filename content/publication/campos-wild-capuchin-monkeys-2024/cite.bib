 abstract = {Studying biological ageing in animal models can circumvent some of the confounds exhibited by studies of human ageing. Ageing research in non-human primates has provided invaluable insights into human lifespan and healthspan. Yet data on patterns of ageing from wild primates remain relatively scarce, centred around a few populations of catarrhine species. Here, we introduce the white-faced capuchin, a long-lived platyrrhine primate, as a promising new model system for ageing research. Like humans, capuchins are highly social, omnivorous generalists, whose healthspan and lifespan relative to body size exceed that of other non-human primate model species. We review recent insights from capuchin ageing biology and outline our expanding, integrative research programme that combines metrics of the social and physical environments with physical, physiological and molecular hallmarks of ageing across the natural life courses of multiple longitudinally tracked individuals. By increasing the taxonomic breadth of well-studied primate ageing models, we generate new insights, increase the comparative value of existing datasets to geroscience and work towards the collective goal of developing accurate, non-invasive and reliable biomarkers with high potential for standardization across field sites and species, enhancing the translatability of primate studies.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue `Understanding age and society using natural populations'.},
