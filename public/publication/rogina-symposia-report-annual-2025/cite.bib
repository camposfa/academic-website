 abstract = {The aging process is universal, and it is characterized by a progressive deterioration and decrease in physiological function leading to decline on the organismal level. Nevertheless, a number of genetic and nongenetic interventions have been described, which successfully extend healthspan and lifespan in different species. Furthermore, a number of clinical trials have been evaluating the feasibility of different interventions to promote human health. The goal of the annual Biological Sciences Section of the Gerontological Society of America meeting was to share current knowledge of different topics in aging research and provide a vision of the future of aging research. The meeting gathered international experts in diverse areas of aging research including basic biology, demography, and clinical and translational studies. Specific topics included metabolism, inflammaging, epigenetic clocks, frailty, senescence, neuroscience, stem cells, reproductive aging, inter-organelle crosstalk, comparative transcriptomics of longevity, circadian clock, metabolomics, and biodemography.},
