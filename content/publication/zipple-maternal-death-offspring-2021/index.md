abstract: Primate offspring often depend on their mothers well beyond the age of weaning,
  and offspring that experience maternal death in early life can suffer substantial
  reductions in fitness across the life span. Here, we leverage data from eight wild
  primate populations (seven species) to examine two underappreciated pathways linking
  early maternal death and offspring fitness that are distinct from direct effects
  of orphaning on offspring survival. First, we show that, for five of the seven species,
  offspring face reduced survival during the years immediately preceding maternal
  death, while the mother is still alive. Second, we identify an intergenerational
  effect of early maternal loss in three species (muriquis, baboons, and blue monkeys),
  such that early maternal death experienced in one generation leads to reduced offspring
  survival in the next. Our results have important implications for the evolution
  of slow life histories in primates, as they suggest that maternal condition and
  survival are more important for offspring fitness than previously realized.
