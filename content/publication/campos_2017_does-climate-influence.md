abstract = "We provide the first comprehensive investigation of vital rate variation in relation to climate variability among wild primates. We ask whether primates are sensitive to global changes that are universal (e.g., higher temperature, large-scale climate oscillations) or whether they are more sensitive to global change effects that are local (e.g., more rain in some places), which would complicate predictions of how primates in general will respond to climate change. To address these questions, we use a database of long-term life-history data for natural populations of seven primate species that have been studied for 29–52 years to investigate associations between vital rate variation, local climate variability, and global climate oscillations. Associations between vital rates and climate variability varied among species and depended on the time windows considered, highlighting the importance of temporal scale in detection of such effects. We found strong climate signals in the fertility rates of three species. However, survival, which has a greater impact on population growth, was little affected by climate variability. Thus, we found evidence for demographic buffering of life histories, but also evidence of mechanisms by which climate change could affect the fates of wild primates."
abstract_short = "There is a growing need to understand how threatened species are affected by climate variability and climate change. We studied how annual birth rates and survival rates vary in relation to climate variability in natural populations of seven primate species that have been studies for 29–52 years. We found climate signals in the birth rates of three species, and a strong climate signal in the infant survival rates of one species. These findings inform us about the resiliency of primate populations to climatic fluctuations, and they reveal ways that climate change could affect the fates of wild primates."
