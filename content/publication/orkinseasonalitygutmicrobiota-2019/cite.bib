 abstract = {Research on the gut microbiota of free-ranging mammals is
offering new insights into dietary ecology. However, for
free-ranging primates, little information is available for
how microbiomes are influenced by ecological variation
through time. Primates inhabiting seasonal tropical dry
forests undergo seasonally specific decreases in food
abundance and water availability, which have been linked to
adverse health effects. Throughout the course of a seasonal
transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three
social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys
(Cebus capucinus imitator) in Sector Santa Rosa, Área
de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. 16S rRNA
sequencing data reveal that unlike other primates, the
white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by
Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects
models indicate that abundances of these genera are
associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of
fruit and arthropods, whereas beta diversity clusters by
rainfall season. Whole shotgun metagenomics revealed that
the capuchin gut is dominated by carbohydrate-binding
modules associated with digestion of plant polysaccharides
and chitin, matching seasonal dietary patterns. We conclude
that rainfall and diet are associated with the diversity,
composition, and function of the capuchin gut microbiome.
Additionally, microbial fluctuations are likely
contributing to nutrient uptake and the~health of wild
primate populations.},
