abstract: Does social isolation in adulthood predict survival because socially isolated
  individuals are already unhealthy due to adversity earlier in life (\"health selection\")?
  Or do adult social environments directly cause poor health and increased mortality
  risk (\"social causation\")? These alternative hypotheses are difficult to disentangle
  in humans because prospective data on survival and the environment for both early
  life and adulthood are rarely available. Using data from the baboon population of
  Amboseli, Kenya, a model for human behavior and aging, we show that early adversity
  and adult social isolation contribute independently to reduced adult survival, in
  support of both health selection and social causation. Further, strong social bonds
  and high social status can buffer some negative effects of early adversity on survival.
  These results support a growing change in perspective, away from \"either-or\" hypotheses
  and towards a multi-causal perspective that points to multiple opportunities to
  mitigate the effects of social adversity.
