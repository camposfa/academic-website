My postdoctoral work in the [Alberts lab](https://sites.duke.edu/albertslab/) at Duke is primarily focused on a phenomenon of modern human societies called the male-female health survival paradox, in which women live longer but experience higher rates of disability and poor health than men.

There is a great deal of evidence that components of this phenomenon have a long evolutionary history in humans (reviewed by [Alberts et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK242444/)), but interestingly, the paradox does not exist in baboons. Male baboons experience both higher mortality rates and steeper rates of age-related declines in health than do female baboons.

These findings call for additional comparative studies to resolve evolutionary roots of the male-female health-survival paradox in humans.

My postdoctoral work examines how social relationships and age-related changes in hormones mediate sex differences in health and survival, using long-term life-history data and noninvasive health measures. The project's broader goal is to improve our understanding of aging in the wild to gain new insights about aging in humans.
