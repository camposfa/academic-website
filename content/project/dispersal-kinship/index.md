This project, directed by my collaborator [Eva Wikberg](https://evawikberg.com/), aims to understand the causes and consequences of sex-biased dispersal patterns. This work has challenged prevailing models that link "species-typical" dispersal with patterns of social social bondedness. Much of this work draws on molecular genetic methods, performed in the laboratories of [Shoji Kawamura](http://www.jinrui.ib.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/kawamura-home-E.html) at the University of Tokyo and [Nelson Ting](http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/TingLab/) at the University of Oregon (and formerly the University of Iowa), to infer kinship and population structure.
