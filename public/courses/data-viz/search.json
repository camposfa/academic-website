In this activity, we’re going to learn a bit about how to use paths correctly to avoid some common errors.\nTo load a file, you need provide a correct path to its location on your computer. The path may be relative or absolute."

    "title": "Paths",
    "section": "Absolute Paths",
    "text": "Absolute Paths\nAn absolute (or “full”) path includes the root (top-level) directory of your filesystem and points to the same location regardless of your R session’s the current working directory. Absolute paths start from your hard drive and include every step (subfolder) you must take through the filesystem to reach the target location. Where you are currently working is irrelevant to the absolute path.\nExamples of absolute paths:\n\nWindows: \"C:\\Users\\czx412\\Documents\\deeply\\nested\\path\\that\\only\\I\\have\\data\\my_file.csv\"\nMac/Linux: \"/Users/czx412/Documents/another/ridiculously/long/path/that/only/I/can/use/data/my_file.csv\"\n\nNote that absolute paths look different depending on the operating system. In Windows, they start with a drive letter followed by a colon, and in Mac/Linux they start with a forward slash.\nAlso, paths in Windows use \\, while Unix/Mac uses /. This difference adds an extra complication: \\ is a special character in R, which means that the Windows path as written above would not work in R. Fortunately, R in Windows can understand paths that use / to separate the folders:\n\nAbsolute path in Windows that works in R: \"C:/Users/czx412/Documents/deeply/nested/path/that/only/I/have/data/my_file.csv\".\n\nYou can still write your paths using \\ if you’re running R on Windows, but because the single backslash is a special character, you need to use two of them each time:\n\nAbsolute path in Windows that works in R, as written by the utterly deranged: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\czx412\\\\Documents\\\\deeply\\\\nested\\\\path\\\\that\\\\only\\\\I\\\\have\\\\data\\\\my_file.csv\".\n\nNow that we’ve gone through all that: NEVER USE ABSOLUTE PATHS IN R!!\nWhy?\nAside from their annoying length, absolute paths don’t work on different computers and tend to break with time. A file that exists in a certain place on your computer almost certainly does not exist in that same place on someone else’s computer, or on another computer that you own or work on. Since it is not reasonable to force people to put files in the same places, it is a good idea to use relative paths. If you share a project with somebody and use relative paths, then these relative paths should work any computer, regardless of where the project root directory is located. This activity is an example.\nNot sharing code with anybody or using on multiple computers at this time? Don’t forget future-you! Current-you should should have an interest in helping future-you to work efficiently rather than sabotaging their work by filling your R scripts with what will eventually become broken file paths."

    "section": "Relative Paths",
    "text": "Relative Paths\nRelative paths are typically far shorter and simpler. A relative path is relative to some assumed starting point, avoiding the need to provide the full, absolute path. For this to work properly, the program needs to know your starting point, which in R is called the working directory.\nHere’s an example of a relative path:\n\nAny system: \"data/my_file.csv\"\n\nThe key to getting relative paths to work in R is understanding R’s working directory.\nWhat is your working directory at this very moment? You can use the getwd() function to find out.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/czx412/Documents/Work/UTSA/Teaching/Data Visualization/Data Visualization - Fall 2023/website/assignments/TEMP_week-02\"\n\n\nThere are a few special characters that are useful when using relative paths:\n\n~ is the user’s home directory. On this particular computer, ~ is equivalent to /Users/czx412. This will change depending on which computer I’m using.\n.. is the parent directory. So ../my_file.csv refers to a file called my_file.csv in the directory that is one level above the working directory.\n\n\n\nR Markdown vs R session or project root\nWhen you’re working in a project, your working directory is the project’s root directory.\nHowever, the default working directory for an R Markdown document is the directory in which that .Rmd document is stored. Suppose that you saved your R Markdown file in a directory called rmd that lives within the root directory of your project, and your data files in another sub-folder called data. Use the file explorer to verify that this is how I organized this project. It is generally a good idea to organize your files in this way. But the working directory of the R Markdown file is now different than your project root directory.\nIn addition, if you use the command setwd() in your R session, then the working directory of your current R session will differ from the working directory of your R Markdown document AND your project root. In brief, lots of potential for total chaos."

We will cover principles of tidy data, strategies for data exploration, and principles of visual presentation. We will use the R computing environment, but no prior programming experience is required. The emphasis is on gaining practical skills that will empower students to answer questions with data.\n\n\nCourse Goals\nThis course will provide students an opportunity to master theoretical concepts in data visualization and to acquire valuable skills for exploring data and producing statistical graphics. Students will learn how to use R to produce visualizations and work with quantitative data, and to apply these skills to communicate scientific knowledge effectively.\n\n\nStudent Learning Objectives/Outcomes\nDuring this semester, students will have the opportunity to:\n\nLearn fundamental principles and best practices for the visual display of quantitative data.\nBecome familiar with data input, analysis, and export using the R statistical computing environment.\nAchieve proficiency with key R packages for data visualization and exploration.\nDevelop skills in written and oral communication and graphical display of data through online activities, small group assignments, and individual projects.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nThere are no prerequisites for this class. In particular, prior programming experience is not required. Some familiarity with quantitative methods and data analysis would be helpful. Students with significant experience in R should still find new things to learn or important knowledge to review in each lesson.\n\n\nCourse Materials\nAll reading materials will be online or posted to the course website. Assigned readings should be completed before the start of class on the day indicated.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website.

These exercises will include activities that the instructor will describe in class. While students are working on these exercises, the instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material that they find confusing, help identify problems that are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel applications and alternative approaches to the data visualization challenges that students are working to complete.\nAssigned in-class exercises can be found under the relevant week of the course schedule.\n\n\nSmall Projects\nDuring the term, there will be two small data visualization projects that each student must complete. The professor will provide a data set and detailed instructions for each project. In brief, the projects will be visualization challenges in which the student will read in the data set in R, produce one or more visualizations of the data, and provide a written narrative (~1000 words) of interesting aspects or insights gained in the process of analyzing the data. The submission should be a Quarto/RMarkdown report in HTML format, and it must include the R code used, the embedded visualizations, and the written narrative. Please also submit the .qmd file used to make the report.\n\n\nFinal Project\nFor the final project, students are encouraged to find and/or use a data set related to their thesis topic, if possible. If this is not possible, the professor can help to find a data set on a topic relevant to the student’s interests. Students must demonstrate and document both data tidying/preparation and data visualization. Further instructions will be provided. The submitted final project should include:\n\nThe raw data set used in the analysis (contact me if there are any concerns about this).\nA Quarto/RMarkdown report in HTML format with all R code used, at least 3 plots, and a written narrative of approximately 1000 words.\nThe .qmd file used to make the report.\nA digital poster (in a digital format such as PDF—no actual printed posters please!), similar to what you might present at an academic conference, that presents your project visually.\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\nRegular attendance will be essential to the successful completion of this course. Attendance is mandatory and will count toward your final grade. We are aiming for a supportive and cooperative learning environment. To accomplish this, I expect students to be actively engaged participants in all classroom activities."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances."
