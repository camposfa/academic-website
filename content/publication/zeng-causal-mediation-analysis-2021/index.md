abstract: Causal mediation analysis studies how the treatment effect of an exposure
  on outcomes is mediated through intermediate variables. Although many applications
  involve longitudinal data, the existing methods are not directly applicable to settings
  where the mediators are measured on irregular time grids. In this paper, we propose
  a causal mediation method that accommodates longitudinal mediators on arbitrary
  time grids and survival outcomes simultaneously. We take a functional data analysis
  perspective and view longitudinal mediators as realizations of underlying smooth
  stochastic processes. We define causal estimands of direct and indirect effects
  accordingly and provide corresponding identification assumptions. We employ a functional
  principal component analysis approach to estimate the mediator process, and propose
  a Cox hazard model for the survival outcome that flexibly adjusts the mediator process.
  We then derive a g-computation formula to express the causal estimands using the
  model coefficients. The proposed method is applied to a longitudinal data set from
  the Amboseli Baboon Research Project to investigate the causal relationships between
  early adversity, adult physiological stress responses, and survival among wild female
  baboons. We find that adversity experienced in early life has a significant direct
  effect on females' life expectancy and survival probability, but find little evidence
  that these effects were mediated by markers of the stress response in adulthood.
  We further developed a sensitivity analysis method to assess the impact of potential
  violation to the key assumption of sequential ignorability.
