 abstract = {Geographically isolated from other C. albifrons taxa found
east of the Andes, the Ecuadorian capuchin (Cebus albifrons
aequatorialis) is a Critically Endangered primate that
survives in a small number of localities in western Ecuador
and extreme northern Peru. We assessed 11 forested areas in
western Ecuador to determine presence/absence using a
combination of on-foot searching and interviews with local
informants. C. a. aequatorialis were present at seven of
the sites surveyed, four of which represent new presence
localities. We carried out extensive censuses of five
small, private reserves to obtain estimates of population
density and demographic information. We also examined home
range characteristics and habitat selection at one
well-studied site. Population densities based on absolute
counts at these sites ranged from 2-22 individuals/km2
(median = 2.4). Jauneche, a 138 ha isolated fragment
reserve with 22 individuals/km2, was a clear outlier.
Although we observed some solitary individuals, C. a.
aequatorialis live predominantly in multi-male multi-female
social groups, with a mean group size of 13.9 (range 5-20).
The composition of social groups was typical for Cebus:
adult females outnumbered adult males slightly, and groups
exhibited relatively high immature to adult female ratios
(mean = 1.5). Home ranges were unusually large for the
genus (507â€“561 ha). The capuchins exhibited
strongest selection for mature forest near streams,
although they also used degraded forest frequently. C. a.
aequatorialis faces critical threats in the form of habitat
loss, hunting, and harassment by farmers, but we suggest
that some remaining populations have the potential to grow
if effective protection can be established.},
