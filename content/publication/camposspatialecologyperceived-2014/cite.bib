 abstract = {Although predation has likely played a central role in the
evolution of primate socioecology, we currently lack a
thorough understanding of how fine-scale variation in
perceived predation risk affects primates' short-term space
use patterns and predator avoidance strategies. We examined
the spatial and ecological characteristics of predator
encounters, as well as behavioral responses to perceived
predation risk, in 5 groups of wild white-faced capuchins
(Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica over a 1.5-year period.
Alarm-calling bouts directed at birds were more likely to
originate in high forest strata, whereas alarm-calling
bouts at snakes and terrestrial quadrupeds were more likely
to originate near the ground. Relative risk maps based on
the locations of predator encounters revealed that
high-risk areas for birds and for all guilds combined
consisted of more mature forest, whereas low-risk areas for
these predators consisted of relatively younger forest. The
animals were most vigilant near the ground, which may
reflect greater perceived exposure to snakes and
terrestrial predators in lower vertical levels.
Incorporating the combined risk function into a predictive
model of vigilance behavior improved prediction relative to
null models of uniform risk or habitat-specific risk. Our
results suggest that capuchin monkeys in this study system
perceive reduced predation risk in the high and middle
forest layers, and they adjust their vigilance behavior to
small-scale spatial variation in perceived risk.},
