 abstract = {Habitat restoration is the intentional process of
initiating or speeding up the recovery of a degraded or
damaged ecosystem through land management activities, often
with the specific aim of increasing the amount of available
habitat for one or more target species. Habitat restoration
is an increasingly important conservation strategy for
animals threatened by habitat reductions and habitat
degradation.},
