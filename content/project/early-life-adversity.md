Adversity during early life can reach far into the future to exert profound effects on health and well-being during adulthood.
Striking parallels exist between early-life effects in humans and in natural animal populations.

The leading conceptual models for early-life effects propose different evolutionary explanations for these phenomena.

__Developmental constraints models__ propose that harsh early-life conditions lead to developmental tradeoffs that prioritize immediate survival at the cost of reduced health, reproduction, and/or survival later in life.

__Predictive adaptive response (PAR) models__ posit that early-life conditions provide cues for predicting future conditions, leading to adaptive responses during development that maximize evolutionary fitness under predicted conditions.


There are several important gaps in our understanding.

__First__, which of these frameworks best explains the emergence of early-life effects in nonhuman primates?
__Second__, to what extent are such effects embedded in our evolutionary history?
__Third__, what are the optimal approaches to mitigating disparities in health and well-being that result from exposure early-life adversity in humans?

Motivated by these questions, I am leveraging a [database of life history data]({{< relref "project/plhd.md" >}}) on seven natural primate populations to shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the far-reaching effects of early-life adversity and to test the universality of these effects among close relatives of humans.
