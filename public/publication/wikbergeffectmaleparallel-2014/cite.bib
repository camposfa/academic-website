 abstract = {Sex-biased dispersal can reduce kin cooperation and kin
competition in the dispersed sex. However, this may not be
the case when group-living animals engage in parallel
dispersal, which occurs when an individual transfers
between groups together with other animals or immigrates
alone into a group that contains familiar animals. Despite
this potential effect on kin cooperation and competition,
few studies have thoroughly investigated how parallel
dispersal affects the kin composition of groups. To further
our understanding of this topic, we investigated the effect
of parallel dispersal on access to coresident kin in male
white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. Between 2006 and
2013, we collected demographic and genetic data from two to
five groups in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. We genotyped
41 females and 39 males at 14 short tandem repeat loci, and
we calculated their estimated relatedness values. The
majority of males dispersed in parallel, and parallel
dispersing males were more closely related to one another
than were other males. Parallel immigrant males and natal
females resided with a similar number of same-sex kin.
Single immigrant males in multimale groups rarely resided
with male kin, and they resided with fewer same-sex kin
than did parallel immigrant males and natal females.
Because parallel dispersal offers an opportunity for males
to form long-lasting cooperative relationships with
familiar kin, this dispersal pattern should be taken into
account in future models of the evolution of social
structure.},
