 abstract = {Reproductive skew in multimale groups may be determined by
the need for alpha males to offer reproductive
opportunities as staying incentives to subordinate males
(concessions), by the relative fighting ability of the
alpha male (tug-of-war) or by how easily females can be
monopolized (priority-of-access). These models have rarely
been investigated in species with exceptionally long male
tenures, such as white-faced capuchins, where female mate
choice for novel unrelated males may be important in
shaping reproductive skew. We investigated reproductive
skew in white-faced capuchins at Sector Santa Rosa, Costa
Rica, using 20~years of demographic, behavioural and
genetic data. Infant survival and alpha male reproductive
success were highest in small multimale groups, which
suggests that the presence of subordinate males can be
beneficial to the alpha male, in line with the concession
model's assumptions. None of the skew models predicted the
observed degree of reproductive sharing, and the
probability of an alpha male producing offspring was not
affected by his relatedness to subordinate males, whether
he resided with older subordinate males, whether he was
prime aged, the number of males or females in the group or
the number of infants conceived within the same month.
Instead, the alpha male's probability of producing
offspring decreased when he was the sire of the mother, was
weak and lacked a well-established position and had a
longer tenure. Because our data best supported the
inbreeding avoidance hypothesis and female choice for
strong novel mates, these hypotheses should be taken into
account in future skew models.},
