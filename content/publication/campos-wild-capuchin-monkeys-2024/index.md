abstract: Studying biological ageing in animal models can circumvent some of the confounds
  exhibited by studies of human ageing. Ageing research in non-human primates has
  provided invaluable insights into human lifespan and healthspan. Yet data on patterns
  of ageing from wild primates remain relatively scarce, centred around a few populations
  of catarrhine species. Here, we introduce the white-faced capuchin, a long-lived
  platyrrhine primate, as a promising new model system for ageing research. Like humans,
  capuchins are highly social, omnivorous generalists, whose healthspan and lifespan
  relative to body size exceed that of other non-human primate model species. We review
  recent insights from capuchin ageing biology and outline our expanding, integrative
  research programme that combines metrics of the social and physical environments
  with physical, physiological and molecular hallmarks of ageing across the natural
  life courses of multiple longitudinally tracked individuals. By increasing the taxonomic
  breadth of well-studied primate ageing models, we generate new insights, increase
  the comparative value of existing datasets to geroscience and work towards the collective
  goal of developing accurate, non-invasive and reliable biomarkers with high potential
  for standardization across field sites and species, enhancing the translatability
  of primate studies.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue `Understanding
  age and society using natural populations'.
