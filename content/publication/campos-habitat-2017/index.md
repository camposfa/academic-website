abstract: "Habitat restoration is the intentional process of initiating or speeding up the recovery of a degraded or damaged ecosystem through land management activities, often with the specific aim of increasing the amount of available habitat for one or more target species. Habitat restoration is an increasingly important conservation strategy for animals threatened by habitat reductions and habitat degradation."
