 abstract = {We examined thermoregulatory behaviors in a wild
population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus)
inhabiting a highly seasonal dry forest in Santa Rosa
National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. The dry season in SRNP
lasts approximately 5 months and is characterized by high
ambient temperatures regularly exceeding 37 degrees C, low
relative humidity, and the near absence of precipitation.
This study demonstrates that capuchins rest more and travel
shorter distances during the hottest and driest hours of
the day, and suggests that they extend their tongues to
lower body temperature via evaporative cooling. Seasonal
weather patterns and group movement data reported here are
based on 940 h of observations on three social groups of
capuchins (wet season: 370 h, dry season: 570 h). In the
dry season, the proportion of time spent resting increased
at higher temperatures whereas the proportion of time spent
traveling decreased. Distance traveled between location
points taken at half-hour intervals decreased significantly
as temperature increased, although the correlation was not
strong. Capuchins exposed their tongues during hot, dry,
windy conditions, and this behavior was much more frequent
in the dry season. Temperature was significantly higher and
humidity significantly lower for "tongue-out" events than
expected for a random event in the dry season. Finally, as
surface water became scarce, home-range areas of heavy use
became increasingly centered on the remaining permanent
water sources. These results suggest that heat stress and
water scarcity are significant influences on the behavior
of capuchins in hot, dry conditions.},
