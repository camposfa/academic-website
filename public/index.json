Studies of how dominance rank affects these outcomes typically employ one of several dominance rank metrics without examining the assumptions each metric makes about its underlying competitive processes. Here we compare the ability of two dominance rank metrics - ordinal rank and proportional or 'standardized' rank - to predict 20 distinct traits in a well-studied wild baboon population in Amboseli, Kenya. We propose that ordinal rank best predicts outcomes when competition is density-dependent, while proportional rank best predicts outcomes when competition is density-independent. We found that for 75% (15/20) of the traits, one of the two rank metrics performed better than the other. Strikingly, all male traits were better predicted by ordinal than by proportional rank, while female traits were evenly split between being better predicted by proportional or ordinal rank. Hence, male and female traits are shaped by different competitive regimes: males' competitive environments are largely driven by density-dependent resource access (e.g., access to estrus females), while females' competitive environments are shaped by both density-independent resource access (e.g. distributed food resources) and density-dependent resource access. However, traits related to competition for social and mating partners are an exception to this sex-biased pattern: these traits were better predicted by ordinal rank than by proportional rank for both sexes. We argue that this method of comparing how different rank metrics predict traits of interest can be used as a way to distinguish between different competitive processes operating in animal societies.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Proportional and Ordinal Dominance Ranks Reveals Multiple Competitive Landscapes in an Animal Society","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586750121,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586750121,"objectID":"69578914a451af26e255beb95b664f7b","permalink":"/project/aging/","publishdate":"2020-04-12T22:55:21-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/aging/","section":"project","summary":"How do health and behavior vary over the life course?","tags":["biodemography"],"title":"Aging","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A major area of uncertainty regarding how primates will respond to climate change involves their interactions with plant foods.

We aimed to investigate how ecological factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet), and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys _(Cebus imitator)_ living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state. As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank. Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones, on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking, lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se, which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition in our study population. This highlights the importance of considering potential differences between reproductive success and proxies of reproductive success, such as energetic condition or food intake, when investigating predictions of socioecological models.","tags":["C-peptide","Dominance","Energy balance","Food availability","Food competition","Ketone","Socioecological theory","Socioecology"],"title":"Non-Invasive Estimation of the Costs of Feeding Competition in a Neotropical Primate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jordan Anderson","Rachel Johnston","Fernando Campos","Amanda J Lea","Tawni N Voyles","Mercy Y Akinyi","Susan Alberts","Elizabeth Archie","Jenny Tung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"4ee44413f420f02610113c804894bbae","permalink":"/publication/andersoncostscompetitionhigh-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T02:28:24.011435Z","relpermalink":"/publication/andersoncostscompetitionhigh-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Aging, for virtually all life, is inescapable. However, within species and populations, rates of biological aging (i.e., physical decline with age) vary across individuals. Understanding sources of variation in biological aging is therefore central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. Here, we constructed a DNA methylation-based predictor of chronological age for a population of wild baboons in which behavioral, ecological, and life history data have been collected for almost 50 years (N = 277 blood samples from 245 individuals, including 30 who were longitudinally sampled). Consistent with findings in humans and model organisms, DNA methylation patterns exhibit a strong, clock-like association with chronological age, but individuals are often predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known age. However, the two most robust predictors of lifespan described for this population—cumulative early adversity and social bond strength—do not explain this deviation. Instead, the single most predictive factor is male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be biologically older than their true chronological age, such that alpha males appear to be nearly a year older than their known age. Longitudinal sampling indicates that males who climb the social hierarchy subsequently look epigenetically \"older,\" likely reflecting the high energetic costs of rank attainment and maintenance in male baboons. Together, our results indicate that environmental effects on survival and epigenetic age can be disjunct, and that achieving high rank for male baboons—the best predictor of reproductive success—imposes physiological costs consistent with a 9live fast, die young9 life history strategy.","tags":null,"title":"The Costs of Competition: High Social Status Males Experience Accelerated Epigenetic Aging in Wild Baboons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy D.

However, area‐wide census methods are time consuming, costly, and not always feasible under many field conditions.

Over the past 35 years, we have conducted 15 area‐wide censuses in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. These efforts have revealed important trends in population growth patterns of capuchin monkeys following the protection and subsequent regeneration of native forests. During this same period, we have also intensively studied a subset of the capuchin groups. Comparing these two datasets, we investigate whether the population structures of the closely monitored groups are reliable indicators of area‐wide demographic patterns. We compare the overall group size and the individual age/sex class compositions of study groups and nonstudy groups (i.e., those contacted during area‐wide censuses only). Our study groups contained more individuals overall with a larger proportion of infants, and there were indications that the proportion of adult and subadult males was lower. These differences can be ascribed either to sampling errors or real differences attributable to human presence and/or better habitat quality for the study groups. No other sex/age classes differed, and major demographic changes were simultaneously evident in both study and nonstudy groups. This study suggests that the Santa Rosa capuchin population is similarly impacted by large‐scale ecological patterns observable within our study groups.","tags":null,"title":"Group versus Population Level Demographics: An Analysis of Comparability Using Long Term Data on Wild White-faced Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Dynamics of Primate Populations in the ACG I am interested in how primate populations change over time as their habitats and climates change.

Throughout the course of a seasonal transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys _(Cebus capucinus imitator)_ in Sector Santa Rosa, Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. 16S rRNA sequencing data reveal that unlike other primates, the white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects models indicate that abundances of these genera are associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of fruit and arthropods, whereas beta diversity clusters by rainfall season. Whole shotgun metagenomics revealed that the capuchin gut is dominated by carbohydrate-binding modules associated with digestion of plant polysaccharides and chitin, matching seasonal dietary patterns. We conclude that rainfall and diet are associated with the diversity, composition, and function of the capuchin gut microbiome.

Focusing on climate variables and landscape-scale vegetation phenology, I describe and quantify typical seasonal patterns, interannual variability, and long-term trends. Santa Rosa’s highly seasonal rainfall patterns show marked interannual variability that is largely driven by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The wettest and driest periods on record have occurred in association with powerful cold ENSO episodes (La Niña) and warm ENSO episodes (El Niño), respectively. Start dates for the wet season can vary by 40 days, but no long-term linear trend was evident in the wet season start dates or in total annual rainfall. Temperature anomalies in Santa Rosa are also strongly associated with ENSO conditions over a backdrop of long-term warming. The annual cycle of plant phenology is dominated by large-scale leaf shedding during the long dry season. The timing and degree of seasonal phenological peaks show complex relationships with rainfall.

My colleagues and I have published studies that document how these challenges are met in a population of arboreal monkeys. These studies provided new insights into the strategies and behavioral tactics used by organisms to contend with periodic biophysical adversity.\nSeasonality in the tropical dry forests of Costa Rica is exceptionally strong. Although the region receives about 1,700 mm of rain each year, the rainfall is almost entirely confined to a 5-6 month wet season with moderate temperatures and lush vegetation. By contrast, the dry season—with its high temperatures and extreme scarcity of surface water—can be a difficult time for the primates. To conserve water, most trees in the forest lose their leaves, exposing the monkeys to intense solar radiation.\nI review these climatic processes in a book chapter: Campos (2018) Primate Life Histories, Sex Roles, and Adaptability - Essays in Honour of Linda M.

Here, we test whether central tenants of the folivory hypothesis of routine trichromacy hold for the foraging ecology of howler monkeys. Howler monkeys (genus _Alouatta_) and paleotropical primates (Parvorder: Catarrhini) have independently acquired routine trichromacy through fixation of distinct mid- to long-wavelength-sensitive (M/LWS) opsin genes on the X-chromosome. The presence of routine trichromacy in howlers, while other diurnal neotropical monkeys (Platyrrhini) possess polymorphic trichromacy, is poorly understood. A selective force proposed to explain the evolution of routine trichromacy in catarrhines—reliance on young, red leaves—has received scant attention in howlers, a gap we fill in this study. We recorded diet, sequenced M/LWS opsin genes in four social groups of _Alouatta palliata_, and conducted colorimetric analysis of leaves consumed in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. For a majority of food species, including Ficus trees, an important resource year-round, young leaves were more chromatically conspicuous from mature leaves to trichromatic than to hypothetical dichromatic phenotypes. We found that 18% of opsin genes were MWS/LWS hybrids; when combined with previous research, the incidence of hybrid M/LWS opsins in this species is 13%. In visual models of food discrimination ability, the hybrid trichromatic phenotype performed slightly poorer than normal trichromacy, but substantially better than dichromacy. Our results provide support for the folivory hypothesis of routine trichromacy. Similar ecological pressures, that is, the search for young, reddish leaves, may have driven the independent evolution of routine trichromacy in primates on separate continents. We discuss our results in the context of balancing selection acting on New World monkey opsin genes and hypothesize that howlers experience stronger selection against dichromatic phenotypes than other sympatric species, which rely more heavily on cryptic foods.","tags":["Alouatta","color vision","Ficus","molecular evolution","opsin","polymorphism","primate evolution","sensory ecology"],"title":"Howler Monkey Foraging Ecology Suggests Convergent Evolution of Routine Trichromacy as an Adaptation for Folivory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Urs Kalbitzer","Mackenzie L.

Individuals may vary in their degree of sociality, and this variation can be associated with differential fitness. In some species, for example, female sociality has a positive effect on infant survival. However, investigations of such cases are still rare, and no previous study has considered how male infanticide might constrain effects of female sociality on infant survival. Infanticide is part of the male reproductive strategy in many mammals, and it has the potential to override, or even reverse, effects of female reproductive strategies, including sociality. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between female sociality, offspring survival, and infanticide risk in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys using long-term data from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Female capuchins formed differentiated bonds, and bond strength was predicted by kin relationship, rank difference, and the presence of female infants. Most females formed stable bonds with their top social partners, although bond stability varied considerably. Offspring of highly social females, who were often high-ranking females, exhibited higher survivorship during stable periods compared with offspring of less social females. However, offspring of highly social females were more likely to die or disappear during periods of alpha male replacements, probably because new alpha males are central to the group, and therefore more likely to target the infants of highly social, central females. This study shows that female sociality in mammals can have negative fitness consequences that are imposed by male behavior.","tags":["capuchin","Infanticide","mammal","Reproductive success","social bond"],"title":"Female Sociality and Sexual Conflict Shape Offspring Survival in a Neotropical Primate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando A.

Long-term, large-scale, and cross-taxon studies of vital rate variation in relation to climate variability can be particularly valuable because they can reveal environmental drivers that affect multiple species over extensive regions. Few such data exist for animals with slow life histories, particularly in the tropics, where climate variation over large-scale space is asynchronous. As our closest relatives, nonhuman primates are especially valuable as a resource to understand the roles of climate variability and climate change in human evolutionary history. Here, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of vital rate variation in relation to climate variability among wild primates. We ask whether primates are sensitive to global changes that are universal (e.g., higher temperature, large-scale climate oscillations) or whether they are more sensitive to global change effects that are local (e.g., more rain in some places), which would complicate predictions of how primates in general will respond to climate change. To address these questions, we use a database of long-term life-history data for natural populations of seven primate species that have been studied for 29–52~years to investigate associations between vital rate variation, local climate variability, and global climate oscillations. Associations between vital rates and climate variability varied among species and depended on the time windows considered, highlighting the importance of temporal scale in detection of such effects. We found strong climate signals in the fertility rates of three species. However, survival, which has a greater impact on population growth, was little affected by climate variability. Thus, we found evidence for demographic buffering of life histories, but also evidence of mechanisms by which climate change could affect the fates of wild primates.","tags":["Climate Change","demographic buffering","El Niño Southern Oscillation","environmental stochasticity","population dynamics","Rainfall","Temperature","vital rates","Weather"],"title":"Does Climate Variability Influence the Demography of Wild Primates?

These models have rarely been investigated in species with exceptionally long male tenures, such as white-faced capuchins, where female mate choice for novel unrelated males may be important in shaping reproductive skew. We investigated reproductive skew in white-faced capuchins at Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica, using 20 years of demographic, behavioural and genetic data. Infant survival and alpha male reproductive success were highest in small multimale groups, which suggests that the presence of subordinate males can be beneficial to the alpha male, in line with the concession model's assumptions. None of the skew models predicted the observed degree of reproductive sharing, and the probability of an alpha male producing offspring was not affected by his relatedness to subordinate males, whether he resided with older subordinate males, whether he was prime aged, the number of males or females in the group or the number of infants conceived within the same month. Instead, the alpha male's probability of producing offspring decreased when he was the sire of the mother, was weak and lacked a well-established position and had a longer tenure. Because our data best supported the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis and female choice for strong novel mates, these hypotheses should be taken into account in future skew models.","tags":["animal mating/breeding systems","behavior/social evolution","inbreeding","Mammals"],"title":"Inbreeding Avoidance and Female Mate Choice Shape Reproductive Skew in Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando A.

We investigated how conservation measures, local rainfall patterns, and large-scale climate oscillations have affected the population dynamics of white-faced capuchins _(Cebus capucinus)_ in a Costa Rican tropical dry forest over a 42-year period after the elimination of most human disturbances. The population's rapid initial growth and later stabilization suggests that it was below the habitat's carrying capacity at the time of the conservation area's establishment. Management practices, such as aggressive fire suppression, may have played an important role in promoting this growth. Rainfall patterns were strongly coupled with phases and intensity conditions of the El Niño Southern Oscillation. The population experienced two distinct growth phases after the conservation area's establishment, a period of rapid growth through the 1980s and 1990s and a subsequent period of stability from about 2000 to the present. El Niño-like conditions in the three years preceding a census year were associated with declines in reproductive output and/or offspring mortality during the rapid growth phase. The sensitivity of this ecosystem to global climatic phenomena suggests that some animals will be negatively affected if drought years become more common as the global climate warms.","tags":["Climate Change","Climate oscillator","El Niño","ENSO","population dynamics","primates","Rainfall"],"title":"Climate Oscillations and Conservation Measures Regulate White-Faced Capuchin Population Growth and Demography in a Regenerating Tropical Dry Forest in Costa Rica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eva C.

To further our understanding of this topic, we investigated the effect of parallel dispersal on access to coresident kin in male white-faced capuchins, _Cebus capucinus_.

Parallel immigrant males and natal females resided with a similar number of same-sex kin. Single immigrant males in multimale groups rarely resided with male kin, and they resided with fewer same-sex kin than did parallel immigrant males and natal females.

Group mass was consistently the most important predictor of home range size in our models, and its effects were relatively insensitive to spatial or temporal scale. Mean daily maximum temperature was an influential factor in shaping monthly range area and composition, with hotter weather favouring smaller home range size and increased use of mature evergreen forest. Greater fruit availability was also associated with smaller monthly range area. The effects of temperature and fruit availability were both scale dependent: the impact of both variables was greatest on the core zone. The different study groups showed marked variation in the habitat composition of their home ranges, but in all groups, higher-use zones consisted of older, more evergreen forest.

We used rigorous statistical methods to examine environmental and social influences on urine-washing behaviour, using 4380 observation hours on five groups of wild white-faced capuchins _(Cebus capucinus)_ in Costa Rica. Urine-washing frequencies were most strongly affected by environmental dryness, both within and between seasons, with markedly less urine-washing during humid conditions. Increased individual activity levels also promoted urine-washing. Among females, urine-washing was less frequent during lactation than during pregnancy and other reproductive states. Among males, urine-washing frequencies were greater in alpha males, who also exhibited a 'vigorous' form of urine-washing that may be functionally distinct. During the dry season, 3/5 groups exhibited more urine-washing than expected near fruit trees, but across groups there were no consistent spatial patterns for urine-washing with respect to water resources, home range overlap zones, core areas, inter-group encounter zones, and the home-range periphery. Urine-washing appears to differ fundamentally from common forms of mammalian scent marking. We suggest that its function is primarily mechanical, perhaps to apply a sticky residue to the hands and feet to improve grip on dry, arboreal substrates.

The composition of social groups was typical for _Cebus_: adult females outnumbered adult males slightly, and groups exhibited relatively high immature to adult female ratios (mean = 1.5). Home ranges were unusually large for the genus (507--561 ha). The capuchins exhibited strongest selection for mature forest near streams, although they also used degraded forest frequently. _C. a. aequatorialis_ faces critical threats in the form of habitat loss, hunting, and harassment by farmers, but we suggest that some remaining populations have the potential to grow if effective protection can be established.","tags":null,"title":"Distribution, Abundance, and Spatial Ecology of the Critically Endangered Ecuadorian Capuchin (Cebus albifrons aequatorialis).","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eva C Wikberg","Pascale Sicotte","Fernando A Campos","Nelson Ting"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"f0ebbff3e29b6db9692e42010290058d","permalink":"/publication/wikbergbetweengroupvariationfemale-2012/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T02:35:17.907356Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wikbergbetweengroupvariationfemale-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"A growing body of evidence shows within-population variation in natal dispersal, but the effects of such variation on social relationships and the kin composition of groups remain poorly understood. We investigate the link between dispersal, the kin composition of groups, and proximity patterns in a population of black-and-white colobus _(Colobus vellerosus)_ that shows variation in female dispersal. From 2006 to 2011, we collected behavioral data, demographic data, and fecal samples of 77 males and 92 females residing in eight groups at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. A combination of demographic data and a genetic network analysis showed that although philopatry was female-biased, only about half of the females resided in their natal groups. Only one group contained female-female dyads with higher average relatedness than randomly drawn animals of both sexes from the same group. Despite between-group variation in female dispersal and kin composition, female-female dyads in most of the study groups had higher proximity scores than randomly drawn dyads from the same group. We conclude that groups fall along a continuum from female dispersed, not kin-based, and not bonded to female philopatric, kin-based, and bonded. We found only partial support for the predicted link between dispersal, kin composition, and social relationships. In contrast to most mammals where the kin composition of groups is a good predictor of the quality of female-female relationships, this study provides further support for the notion that kinship is not necessary for the development and maintenance of social bonds in some gregarious species.","tags":["Animal Distribution","Animals","Colobus","Colobus: genetics","Colobus: physiology","Colobus: psychology","Female","Homing Behavior","Male","Object Attachment","Population Dynamics","Sex Factors"],"title":"Between-Group Variation in Female Dispersal, Kin Composition of Groups, and Proximity Patterns in a Black-and-White Colobus Monkey (Colobus vellerosus).","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando A.

The dry season in SRNP lasts approximately 5 months and is characterized by high ambient temperatures regularly exceeding 37 degrees C, low relative humidity, and the near absence of precipitation. This study demonstrates that capuchins rest more and travel shorter distances during the hottest and driest hours of the day, and suggests that they extend their tongues to lower body temperature via evaporative cooling. Seasonal weather patterns and group movement data reported here are based on 940 h of observations on three social groups of capuchins (wet season: 370 h, dry season: 570 h). In the dry season, the proportion of time spent resting increased at higher temperatures whereas the proportion of time spent traveling decreased. Distance traveled between location points taken at half-hour intervals decreased significantly as temperature increased, although the correlation was not strong. Capuchins exposed their tongues during hot, dry, windy conditions, and this behavior was much more frequent in the dry season. Temperature was significantly higher and humidity significantly lower for \"tongue-out\" events than expected for a random event in the dry season. Finally, as surface water became scarce, home-range areas of heavy use became increasingly centered on the remaining permanent water sources. These results suggest that heat stress and water scarcity are significant influences on the behavior of capuchins in hot, dry conditions.","tags":["Acclimatization","Acclimatization: physiology","Animal","Animal: physiology","Animals","Behavior","Cebus","Cebus: physiology","Climate","costa rica","Face","Face: anatomy \u0026 histology","Face: physiology","Hot Temperature","Humidity","Seasons","Temperature","Water Supply"],"title":"Behavioral Adaptations to Heat Stress and Water Scarcity in White-Faced Capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Distribution and abundance of the Ecuadorian capuchin The Ecuadorian capuchin (Cebus albifrons aequatorialis) is a critically endangered primate found only in the fragmented forests of western Ecuador and northern Peru, which are among the most imperiled ecosystems on earth.

We used 2274 h of focal follows of 35 adult and subadult wild white-faced capuchins _(Cebus capucinus)_ to test 1) the intergroup signaling, intragroup social signaling, and thermoregulatory hypotheses for UW and 2) the hypothesis that individuals sniff each other's urine and other traces to gather socially significant information. Males engaged in significantly more UW than females. All 5 $α$-males engaged in more UW than subordinate males did, including 4 $α$-males that increased their UW rate above that of their male groupmates after their rise to $α$ rank. Males engaged in significantly less UW while in view of other males than at other times. Male-male sniffing rates do not correlate with either aggression rate or dominance rank distance. Urine washing rates did not increase while subjects were in parts of their home range where more intergroup encounters occurred. Urine washing rates were highest early in the morning and late in the afternoon, presumably when temperatures were coolest. The data do not support either the thermoregulatory or social signaling hypothesis. We suggest that experiments with captive capuchins are necessary to resolve the issue of the function of urine washing in the taxon.","tags":["Anthropology","Cebus capucinus","Evolutionary Biology","Human Genetics","olfactory communication","thermoregulation","urine washing"],"title":"Urine Washing and Sniffing in Wild White-Faced Capuchins (Cebus capucinus): Testing Functional Hypotheses","type":"publication"}]
