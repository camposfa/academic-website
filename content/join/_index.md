We combine field, laboratory, and computational approaches to study questions about evolution, ecology, behavior, and health in nonhuman primates. We are particularly interested in understanding how social and environmental experiences across the life course relate to individual differences in behavior, health, survival, and fertility. The majority of this work focuses on wild populations of primates in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica, but we work with other study systems as well.

Potential trainees who are interested in joining my research group at UTSA should have research interests that align well with these topics.

At UTSA's Department of Anthropology, we offer the following graduate degrees:

- [Thesis-based M.A. in Anthropology](http://anthropology.utsa.edu/masters): A thesis-based M.A. is a great option for applicants who are considering careers related to Biological Anthropology, including academic careers, but they are not yet sure about about their research interests or perhaps lack prior research experience. An M.A. thesis typically involves short stints of field or lab research on one or two straightforward research questions that can be addressed in a relatively short period of time. It is therefore a much smaller commitment than a Ph.D.
- [Coursework-based M.A. in Anthropology](http://anthropology.utsa.edu/masters): Although the information on the department website is outdated and does not describe this option, we also offer coursework-based M.A. degrees. This option may be particularly good for students who want to go into non-academic careers related to biological anthropology, including (but not limited to) zoological work, NGOs, captive primate care, research labs, and a wide range of industry jobs for which an M.A. degree may be an important asset.
- [Ph.D in Anthropology](http://anthropology.utsa.edu/doctoral): A Ph.D dissertation project should aim to expand our current knowledge by addressing new or unresolved questions that are of broad significance. Accordingly, I am most interested in supervising Ph.D students who will formulate and address new and exciting research questions, including those that use new approaches, methods, or theoretical ideas. I will be happy to work with you to develop such questions. Generally, I expect incoming Ph.D students to have some research experience, and ideally, they should have a strong background in quantitative methods. An M.A. degree is not required to apply to the Ph.D program but would be an advantage.


I do not currently have postdoctoral positions to offer, but if you're interested in doing postdoctoral research in my lab, please do get in touch with me. There may be opportunities in the near future, and we can discuss possible external sources of funding, including Postdoctoral Research Fellowships through the [National Science Foundation](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbe-postdoctoral-research-fellowships-sprf) or the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/training/funding-opportunities-for-postdoctoral-fellows).

If you'd like to apply to join my lab, please send me an email that includes:

- Your research interests 
- A description of previous research experiences and qualifications
- Why you're interested in working with my lab
- Your current CV
