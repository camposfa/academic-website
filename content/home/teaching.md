I believe that my foremost responsibility as an educator is to provide students with skills that prepare them for rewarding careers. A broad-based education that merges natural and social sciences can serve this goal by encouraging critical thinking and promoting integrative approaches that embrace diverse points of view. My teaching philosophy is oriented around meeting this responsibility, and it has three pillars: meticulous preparation, fundamental respect, and a dedication to challenging students to become informed and engaged citizens.
