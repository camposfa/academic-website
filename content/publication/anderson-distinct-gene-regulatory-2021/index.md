abstract: The social environment is a major determinant of morbidity, mortality,
  and Darwinian fitness in social animals. Recent studies have begun to uncover the
  molecular processes associated with these relationships, but the degree to which
  they vary across different dimensions of the social environment remains unclear.
  Here, we draw on a long-term field study of wild baboons to compare the signatures
  of affiliative and competitive aspects of the social environment in white blood
  cell gene regulation, under both immune stimulated and non-stimulated conditions.
  We find that the effects of dominance rank on gene expression are directionally
  opposite in males versus females, such that high-ranking males resemble low-ranking
  females, and vice-versa. Among females, rank and social bond strength are both reflected
  in the activity of cellular metabolism and proliferation genes. However, pronounced
  rank-related differences in baseline immune gene activity are near-absent for social
  bond strength, while only bond strength predicts the fold-change response to immune
  (lipopolysaccharide) stimulation. Together, our results indicate that the directionality
  and magnitude of social effects on gene regulation depend on the aspect of the social
  environment under study. This heterogeneity may help explain why social environmental
  effects on health and longevity can also vary between measures.
