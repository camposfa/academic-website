abstract: 'Adverse conditions in early life can have negative consequences for adult
  health and survival in humans and other animals. What variables mediate the relationship
  between early adversity and adult survival? Adult social environments represent
  one candidate: Early life adversity is linked to social adversity in adulthood,
  and social adversity in adulthood predicts survival outcomes. However, no study
  has prospectively linked early life adversity, adult social behavior, and adult
  survival to measure the extent to which adult social behavior mediates this relationship.
  We do so in a wild baboon population in Amboseli, Kenya. We find weak mediation
  and largely independent effects of early adversity and adult sociality on survival.
  Furthermore, strong social bonds and high social status in adulthood can buffer
  some negative effects of early adversity. These results support the idea that affiliative
  social behavior is subject to natural selection through its positive relationship
  with survival, and they highlight possible targets for intervention to improve human
  health and well-being.'
