# Biography

<!-- I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Biology Department at Duke University, working in the lab of [Susan Alberts](https://sites.duke.edu/albertslab/). My research focuses on  -->

Understanding and predicting the effects climate change, habitat loss, and other human disturbances on natural populations is one of the grand challenges for today's natural scientists.

My research is in the broad area of behavioral responses to changing environments, both ecological and social. We still do not fully understand the limits of behavioral flexibility or whether adaptive responses will be sufficient to keep pace with rapidly changing environmental conditions. These gaps in our understanding motivate the goals of my research: _to shed light on the limits, consequences, and evolutionary roots of flexible responses to environments that change in time or space._ 

Most of my research has been carried out with natural primate populations, mainly white-faced capuchins in the [Área de Conservación Guanacaste](http://www.acguanacaste.ac.cr/) in northwestern Costa Rica. My postdoctoral research focuses on [savannah baboons](https://amboselibaboons.nd.edu/) in the Amboseli ecosystem of East Africa, and I also do comparative research with the [Primate Life History Database](http://www.plhdb.org).

<!-- My recent research involves white-faced capuchins in the [Área de Conservación Guanacaste](http://www.acguanacaste.ac.cr/), a Unesco World Heritage site in northwestern Costa Rica. At this field site, established by [Linda Fedigan](http://www.ucalgary.ca/~fedigan/fedigan.htm), the capuchins have been studied continuously for over three decades. -->
