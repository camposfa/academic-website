abstract: Is it possible to slow the rate of ageing, or do biological constraints
  limit its plasticity? We test the `invariant rate of ageing' hypothesis, which posits
  that the rate of ageing is relatively fixed within species, with a collection of
  39 human and nonhuman primate datasets across seven genera. We first recapitulate,
  in nonhuman primates, the highly regular relationship between life expectancy and
  lifespan equality seen in humans. We next demonstrate that variation in the rate
  of ageing within genera is orders of magnitude smaller than variation in pre-adult
  and age-independent mortality. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in the rate
  of ageing, but not other mortality parameters, produce striking, species-atypical
  changes in mortality patterns. Our results support the invariant rate of ageing
  hypothesis, implying biological constraints on how much the human rate of ageing
  can be slowed.
