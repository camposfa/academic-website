 abstract = {A growing body of evidence shows within-population
variation in natal dispersal, but the effects of such
variation on social relationships and the kin composition
of groups remain poorly understood. We investigate the link
between dispersal, the kin composition of groups, and
proximity patterns in a population of black-and-white
colobus (Colobus vellerosus) that shows variation in female
dispersal. From 2006 to 2011, we collected behavioral data,
demographic data, and fecal samples of 77 males and 92
females residing in eight groups at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. A
combination of demographic data and a genetic network
analysis showed that although philopatry was female-biased,
only about half of the females resided in their natal
groups. Only one group contained female-female dyads with
higher average relatedness than randomly drawn animals of
both sexes from the same group. Despite between-group
variation in female dispersal and kin composition,
female-female dyads in most of the study groups had higher
proximity scores than randomly drawn dyads from the same
group. We conclude that groups fall along a continuum from
female dispersed, not kin-based, and not bonded to female
philopatric, kin-based, and bonded. We found only partial
support for the predicted link between dispersal, kin
composition, and social relationships. In contrast to most
mammals where the kin composition of groups is a good
predictor of the quality of female-female relationships,
this study provides further support for the notion that
kinship is not necessary for the development and
maintenance of social bonds in some gregarious species.},
