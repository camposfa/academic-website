My recent field research has focused on primates in the [Área de Conservación Guanacaste](http://www.acguanacaste.ac.cr/) (ACG), a Unesco World Heritage site in northwestern Costa Rica that supports extraodrinary biodiversity. The conservation area comprises several different sectors that extend from the Pacific Ocean over a chain of dormant volcanos to the Atlantic slope.

One particularly well-studied part of the ACG is the Santa Rosa sector. The white-faced capuchins in Santa Rosa are studied under the directorship of [Linda Fedigan](http://people.ucalgary.ca/~fedigan/fedigan.htm), [Katharine Jack](https://kjack.tulane.edu/), and [Amanda Melin](http://www.amandamelin.com/).

The black-handed spider monkeys are studied by [Filippo Aureli](https://www.uv.mx/personal/faureli/) and [Colleen Schaffner](https://www.uv.mx/personal/cschaffner/).
